## 🔎 Key Findings

Income strongly influences spending with a predictive accuracy of 67%, suggesting demographic-based targeting can improve revenue.

Customer sign-ups peak in January and March, while sharp declines in November and December highlight opportunities for seasonal marketing strategies.

Most spending occurs between $1 and $418.50, indicating that a layered rewards or loyalty program aimed at this group could improve retention.

Ages 36–50 and 51–65 spend the most, particularly on Wine and Meat. This suggests targeted promotions for these categories and deeper research to understand why other categories underperform for these age groups.
